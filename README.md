# List cards BLoC App

Application allows to add and remove items contains ECG widget to list using BLoC.

## Introduction
This application is a development of the project https://github.com/mk590901/graph_widget. In it, the simplest __BLoC__ widget, created earlier, is built into the Card widget and controlled by it. Just an example of a small integration that brings the application closer to reality.
## Primary goal
The state of __ItemBloc__ is the mutable list itself and there are two events: __AddItemEvent__ for adding a row to the list and __RemoveItemEvent__ for removing the first item in the list. __Note__: To implement adding and removing Card widgets to/from the items list using the BLoC approach. The original ECG widget added a bit of hassle, but the problem was still resolved. Note: The state of __ItemBloc__ is the mutable list itself and there are two events: __AddItemEvent__ for adding a row to the list and __RemoveItemEvent__ for removing the first item in the list.
### Notes
it's possible this is an interim project that may be further developed.
